## üìã How to Use

Using the tool is a simple four-step process:

1.  **Generate a GitHub Token:**
    *   The tool needs permission to read and write labels on your behalf. You can provide this by creating a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.
    *   **[Click here to generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GitHub%20Label%20Copier)**.
    *   The link pre-selects the required `repo` scope. Just scroll down and click **"Generate token"**.
    *   **Copy the token immediately!** You won't be able to see it again.

2.  **Fill in the Repositories:**
    *   **Source Repository:** The repo you want to copy labels *from* (e.g., `facebook/react`).
    *   **Target Repository:** The repo you want to copy labels *to* (e.g., `YourUsername/my-awesome-project`).

3.  **Choose Your Options:**
    *   Check the "Delete existing labels..." box if you want to make the target repository's labels an exact mirror of the source.

4.  **Copy!**
    *   Click the "Copy Labels" button and watch the log for real-time progress.

## üîí A Note on Security

Your security is paramount. Here‚Äôs how your token is handled:

*   Your Personal Access Token is stored **only in your browser's memory** while you have the page open.
*   It is sent **directly to the GitHub API** over a secure HTTPS connection and is never sent to or stored on any other server.
*   For maximum security, **we strongly recommend you delete the token** from your [GitHub tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) after you are finished using the tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project is a pure static web application built with:

*   **HTML:** For the structure and content.
*   **CSS:** For clean, modern styling.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, including `async/await` and the `fetch` API to communicate directly with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

Because it's a static site, it can be hosted for free and with great performance on **GitHub Pages**.
